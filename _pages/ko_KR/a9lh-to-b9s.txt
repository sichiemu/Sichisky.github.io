This page is for existing arm9loaderhax users to update their devices to boot9strap.

All future releases of Luma3DS will only be made in the `.firm` format, which will only be compatible with boot9strap and sighax. This means that to continue receiving the latest updates of Luma3DS, you should use this page to update your installation.

이 페이지의 [마그넷](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) 링크를 사용하려면

If you have a PIN enabled on Luma3DS, SafeB9SInstaller will give you an "OTP Crypto Fail" error unless you temporarily disable your PIN (you can re-enable the PIN after the update).

#### What you need

Note that the following required file named `secret_sector.bin` is the same one that was found in the various `data_input.zip` file versions. If you already have that file on your disk somewhere, you can use that one instead of downloading the one below.
{: .notice--info}

Note that, on New 3DS, `secret_sector.bin` is needed to revert the arm9loaderhax exploit, which is why it is not needed for the installation of boot9strap on a stock console. If you do not have a New 3DS, you do not need `secret_sector.bin`.
