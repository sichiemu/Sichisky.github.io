title: "Installing boot9strap (Homebrew Launcher)"
---

If you have already hacked your device before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. EmuNANDとRedNANDは[同じ理論](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection)の少々違う実装です。

#### 手順

##### Section I - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
1. Once it has completed, press (Start) to exit udsploit
  + This may take several tries
  + 画面がフリーズした場合、電源ボタン長押しで強制的に電源を切り、もう一度やり直してください
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on
  + If you *still* get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, try using the [r19 release of safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/tag/r19)
  + 画面がフリーズした場合、電源ボタン長押しで強制的に電源を切り、もう一度やり直してください
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section II - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device

##### セクション III - Luma3DSを設定する

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_sys_b9s)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **「Show NAND or user string in System Settings」**
1. (Start) を押してセーブして再起動します
  + If you get an error, just continue the next page
