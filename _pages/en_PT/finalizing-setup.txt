title: "Finalizin' Setup"

#### Overview 'o steps

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload in the FIRM format. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

Durin' 'tis process, we also setup programs such as th' followin':    

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games 'n applications)*
+  **Themely** *(installs custom themes)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates ye CFW installation easily)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*
+  **Homebrew Launcher Loader** *(launches the Homebrew Launcher as a regular application thanks to Rosalina magic)*

#### What ye need

* The latest release of [Themely](https://github.com/ihaveamac/Themely/releases/latest) *(the `.cia` file)*
* Th' latest release 'o [hblauncher_loader](https://github.com/yellows8/hblauncher_loader/releases/latest)
* Th' latest release 'o [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [DSP1](https://github.com/zoogie/DSP1/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/releases/latest) *(the `.cia` and `.3dsx` files)*
* The latest fork of [Luma3DS Updater](https://github.com/KunoichiZ/lumaupdate/releases/latest) *(the `.cia` file)*
* [`setup_ctrnand_luma3ds.gm9`]({{ base_path }}/gm9_scripts/setup_ctrnand_luma3ds.gm9)
* [`cleanup_sd_card.gm9`]({{ base_path }}/gm9_scripts/cleanup_sd_card.gm9)

{% capture notice-10 %}
Ye can now use Luma3DS Updater to update ye Luma3DS to th' latest version just by openin' it 'n pressin' (A).

This is not the same thing as a System Update; it just downloads and extracts the newest Luma3DS files.

This will only update the Luma3DS files on your SD card. If you boot your device without an SD card, it will use the version you placed in CTRNAND.

{% capture notice-6 %}   
You will now boot Luma3DS CFW SysNAND by default.    

Ye can now hold (Select) on boot to launch th' Luma3DS configuration menu.    

You can now hold (Start) on boot to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu (note that the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected).    

You can now hold (Start) + (Select) + (X) on boot to dump the ARM11 bootrom (`boot11.bin`), the ARM9 bootrom (`boot9.bin`), and your console unique OTP (`OTP.bin`) to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card (note that this will not have any kind of prompt or message).    

You can now press (L) + (Down) + (Select) while the system is booted to open the Rosalina menu integrated into Luma3DS. For a full list of Rosalina features, please see the [Luma3DS v8.0 Release](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)
