    {: .notice--info}

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device

##### Section II - ntrboot

1. Use the magnet to find the spot on your device where the sleep sensor is triggered
  + This step is not needed on the old 2DS (which has a sleep mode switch)
1. Power off your device
1. Insert your flashcart into your device
1. Place the magnet on your device to trigger the sleep sensor
  + On old 2DS, you should instead enable the sleep mode switch
1. Hold (Power) + (Start) + (Select) + (X) for several seconds, then release the buttons
  + It may take a few attempts to get this to work because the positioning is awkward
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, force your device to power off by holding down the power button
  + Your device will only boot to the SafeB9SInstaller screen until the next section is completed

##### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Delete `boot.firm` from the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.7z` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Your device should have booted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_sys_b9s)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get an error, just continue the next page

Continue to [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup)
{: .notice--primary}

___

The following are optional sections that will allow you to restore your flashcart to its original state (to allow it to be used for its standard functions).

Note that the Acekard 2i retains its ability to launch `.nds` files while having the ntrboot exploit installed. This only applies when the Acekard 2i is in a 3DS running some kind of custom firmware! While the ntrboot exploit is installed to the Acekard 2i, it will be unable to launch `.nds` files on stock NDS, NDSL, DSi, or 3DS system.

Do not follow any of these sections until you have completed the rest of the instructions on this page.

##### Section V (i) - Removing ntrboot (NDS Flasher)

1. Eject your flashcart from **the target 3DS**
1. Reinsert your flashcart into **the source NDS / NDSL** with the SD card removed
1. Press (Y) to "restore flashrom"
1. Press (B) to "EXIT"

##### Section V (ii) - Removing ntrboot (3DS Multi System)

1. Launch the Luma3DS chainloader by holding (Start) during boot on **the source 3DS**
1. Select "ntrboot_flasher"
1. Select "Restore Flash"
1. Press (Y) to proceed
1. Wait until the process is completed
1. Press (B) to return to the main menu
1. Select "EXIT" to power off **the source 3DS**

##### Section V (iii) - Removing ntrboot (3DS Single System)

###### What you need
