title: "Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)"
---

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.

Note that more recent 3DS versions have blocked access to some flashcarts. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on newer versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files under the following versions:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : All Versions <= 11.5.0
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : All Versions <= 4.3.0

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
